### ⚠️ This is still in development ⚠️ 
### There will be a lot of missing features

# DustOS

DustOS is my first attempt of making an operating system. 

A lot of code in this repository I have not written my self as I am lazy.. 

I have tweaked some files to my own liking and used the OSDev wiki as guidance.

The aim of this operating system is to help me get a better understading on low level programming.

I have linked below the repo/s that I have used code from/or have taken inspiration from:

- https://github.com/FRosner/FrOS
- https://github.com/cia-foundation/TempleOS

- x86 BIOS
